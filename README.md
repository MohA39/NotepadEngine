Notepad Engine is a C# video game framework that runs video games comprised of emoji characters complete with rendering, keyboard input, and audio on Microsoft Notepad to prove once and for all that anything can be a game engine if you try hard enough!

## Documentation

Documentation is still a work-in-progress, however, Example_FlappyBird provides a complete illustration of Notepad Engine features with a recreation of the popular mobile game, Flappy Bird.

**Warning: Notepad Engine has only been tested on Microsoft Windows 11 version 10.0.22000.3079 and may not work on other versions.**
